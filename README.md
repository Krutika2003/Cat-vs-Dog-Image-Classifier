Cat vs Dog Image Classifier
This project implements an image classifier using machine learning techniques to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

Overview :
The objective of this project is to create a robust image classifier capable of accurately categorizing images as either cats or dogs. The classifier is built using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs), leveraging Tensorflow and Keras libraries for deep learning.
